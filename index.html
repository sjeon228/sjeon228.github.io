			<p>
			I was born in Korea but moved to Austin when I was 6 years old. I went to UT and graduated in 2012 with a BA in Radio-TV-Film. In 2013 I started a career in the solder mount technology industry as a field service engineer for Kohyoung America.

			<p>
			I've always had a passion for technology and being able to create and work on projects. Web development involves both of those things which is what drew me to it. Also, working as a service engineer taught me some skills about troubleshooting and debugging issues that I am hoping I can use as a web developer.
